<title>War Thunder Russian Bias</title>
</style>
<P>
<h1 style="color:white;">War Thunder features an extensive range of military vehicles from various nations, but many players argue that the Soviet Union holds a distinct advantage in certain areas, leading to the infamous perception of "Russian bias" in the game. Whether true or exaggerated, Soviet vehicles stand out in their durability and firepower, often excelling in battles.
</P>
<P>
Most Popular Soviet Vehicles  
The most iconic Soviet tanks, like the T-34 and IS-2, are known for their excellent armor and firepower. These tanks frequently dominate mid-tier battles with their ability to withstand hits while dealing heavy damage. The T-34's mobility combined with the IS-2's firepower makes Soviet tanks favorites for many players.

<P>
Higher-Tier Soviet Dominance  
At higher tiers, vehicles like the T-72 and the MiG-21 continue to fuel the "Russian bias" conversation. The T-72’s advanced armor and firepower, paired with the MiG-21’s superior speed and agility in air battles, often leave opponents feeling outmatched.
Whether you believe in the bias or not, the Soviet tech tree in War Thunder offers some of the most powerful and enduring vehicles in the game, making them a popular choice for players seeking heavy-hitting tanks and fast jets!</h1>
