<h1>War Thunder Arcade Battles Overview</h1>
 
<p>In **Arcade Air Battles**, you experience faster-paced gameplay with simplified controls and aiming assistance, making it easier to track and shoot enemies. Planes are more responsive, and players can see enemy positions at all times, adding to the intense dogfights.</p>
 
<p>In **Arcade Tank Battles**, players enjoy easier handling with crosshair aids for shooting. Tanks are quicker to repair, and visibility is better, with opponents marked on the map to keep the action exciting.</p>
 
<p>**Arcade Naval Battles** bring fast-paced combat to the seas. Ships move faster, and aiming aids help players land shots on enemy vessels more easily. Battles feel more action-packed with simplified mechanics.</p>
 
<h1>Realistic Battles</h1>
<p>In **Realistic Air Battles**, you have to manage things like fuel, ammo, and aircraft damage. There’s no enemy marker showing their positions, so you have to rely on tactics and strategy. Planes handle more like they would in real life, adding to the challenge.</p>
 
<p>In **Realistic Tank Battles**, it’s much harder to detect enemies without the help of markers. Players need to use their surroundings to outsmart opponents, and vehicle handling is more accurate, making strategy key to winning.</p>
 
<p>**Realistic Naval Battles** slow the pace down, with more focus on realistic ship handling and tactics. Players must account for the ship’s weight, speed, and realistic aiming without assistive markers, offering a more strategic and challenging experience.</p>
